# first-steps-to-starting-over
recovery is a long road this is my personal expertise from hit rock-bottom with my health and starting my life over after 10 years. This is a genral guide to overcoming any life event that has made you question yourself to the core. This is actionable adivce wither your are recoverying from health issues, suffering from mental health issues, and or addiction. For me personally it has been PTSD and uncontroled seizures that have stripped of myself worth. I am slowly climbing out of that same dark place and this isn't the first time. I have learned alot in the last ten years about how to pull myself up from the darkest of mindsets and I found it gets easier and easier each time. I have learned soild skills that keep me from truely losing my why.
