<h2 id="Acceptance">Acceptance</h2>
<p>Hit rock bottom is something that is never easy. There are countless reasons on could end up in a place in there life that they would describe as rock bottom. For some people this is addiction while other it maybe event outside there control. Mental and/or physical health, loss of a employment or countless personal choices can lead some one to a very low place so it is important not to judges yourself you got here. Instead I offer this learn to accept both the things that are in your control and the things that are not. This doesn't mean you stay stagnet it simply means you are letting go of the guilt same and negitive feeling that built up. This is a vital first step because it frees your mind, heart and soul to move forward.</p>
<h3>5 Affermations for Acceptance</h3>

    <li>I got this</li>
    <li>I am free froms shame and guilt</li>
    <li>I am better everyday</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ChallangeYourself">Challange Yourself</h2>
<p>Challanging yourself every day is going to be the a piviol action to take. Here is where we really focus on not giving up and building disapline so we don't revert to our old ways. My best advice to anyone in any recovery is to pick on imposible goal that you can feel excited about. One with small steps to achive and make that your drive in life. Make every action lead into this one thing. So for me I picked coding for many reasons one was I have been in such a toxic head space and so depressed about the fact that with my seizures I could do nothing to pull myself out of poverity. I was trapped with no options. Why doesn't matter this is the truth I had. So I made a choice to go back to school something I have failed at several times because of my seizures and I dont' care for formal education system. So this wasn't going to be the right chocie bt I was despraite. I challanged myself that day to create a goal to work on and I was not give up. So I picked the three degree options Teaching because it was the most practical. I didn't feel a calling but it was doable. I also had sevveral people who went through teaching programs so possible support. I picked online marketing because I saw were I could go with that it is very practical as well and a bit more intresting to me. However I picked software develeompent because it terffied me but I also found the idea of knowing how everything is made and making cool apps and websites and word press templetes thrilling. This was also the most challanging for me as I have very week math skills. I could have rain but I decided I would google what it took to be software dev and google led me to a free teach your self curriculum with certificates that would change my life. In one week I am doing the impossilbe I am makeing a really simple website. I have only completed one section of one cerfivation. Yet my mind is in a totally different place. I am making goals and trying to slowly deal withthe chaos months of depression has caused. I acdept that is where I am starting this time. So how can you challange yourself? Maybe it is simple getting out of bed every day and going for a ten mintute walk or making a carreer change Like I am. It really doesn't matter just do it.Start small and work your way up if your new to pushing yourself or go a little bigger if you know you can. Don't do to much at once though and if you have a off day remember step one always. Here is a simple challange to get you started if you don't know where to start.</p>

<h2 id="Flexablity">Flexablity</h2>
<p>Flexablity works hand it had with both acceptance and challanging yourself. YOu need to be flexiable to set knew goals to be realist and big dreamer takes a constaint shift to keep the balance. YOu can't recover if you fail to accept that you are not who you were yesterday or last week or last year or when ever things feel apart. Yes you are starting a new leaf yet you are still healing and recoverying from it too so you need to be flexable some days you will be slipping into old thought patterns while other you maybe feeling overwelemed withthe changes you are making. these things are normal part of the process the goal is just to inch forward if that is all you can do and to soar by leaps and bounds when you can. Why because we can control much in life but we can control how we react to it and how we move through it. Tip start doing yoga it is a living metifor for this whole process. at first your mucesles will fight to stay ridge it but every time they release a little bit more you feel more reief and stregh.</p>
<h2 id="DreamsandGoals">Dreams and Goals</h2>
<p>I debted putting this as the first goal because it really helps to have a goal a end result and big dreams. Infact there is a lotof sicences to this that if you can envision your perfect life and all the steps it takes to get ther eyou ware way more likely to achieve that dream. Well I found that I was in such a dark place a few years back I couldn't dream. I live in a area with a lot of drug abuse and addiction is everywhere I have talk to so many people who just can dream or picture there future because they have lived so long in darkness. Through trail and error I found that first I had to accept liife than push myself out of bed off my ass and into living again. than I could start to dream and plan and plot my path even before i was in a great head frame. So where do you start. here are a few tips and ideas to get you thinking about your future get your self a journal first offf and write your thoughs feeling and anything you feel about these tips you be surpised how much clearlity just wrting a answer out can give you when thinking seems to fail you.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go through a lifestyle mag, pintrerst, or Instagram. What makes you say I wish I...? than ask yourself why?</li>
    <li>What passions did you have before you lost your way? are there any you regreat giving up?</li>
    <li>Where would you live if you could live anywhere?</li>

</ol>

<h2 id="Health">Health</h2>
<p>Health is so important and while it is last it might be the most important and infact could even be a great first step if you are struggling with acceptance. I would even incourage you to purse both at the same time. You need holistic health what I mean is whole system health your mental health you may need therapy or a life coach. Physical health get healthy loose weight drink water we all know what we need to work on but also get a physical health screaning you may have let things go. if you physiall are well it is eaiser to get mentally well and spirtually well. Spirtually well can mean different things for differnet people. If you follow a religon connect deeper with it. if not connect deeper withyoru self and nature learn what sets you on fire.</p>
